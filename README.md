# Facial Emotion Recognition

#### To detect different human emotions in any given facial image. 

## Description

In this project, a computer visison based machine learning model is developed to detect seven different emotions in any given facial image. Python libraries such as openCV, keras, tensorflow and fastai are used. Multi-layered Convolutional Neural Network is implemented in this project.

## Analysis 
Handling data imbalance using class weights and fine tuning the Convolutional Neural Network improved the accuracy from 27% to 65%.
